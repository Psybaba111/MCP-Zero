You are an expert in information extraction and technical documentation analysis. Your task is to read the provided MCP server README file and extract structured information in the following JSON format:

{
  "server_name": string, // The name of the MCP server, extracted or inferred from the README
  "server_description": string, // A summary of the server's purpose and capabilities, based on all relevant parts of the README. Do NOT include installation, configuration, or unrelated operational details.
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": string, // The function/tool name
      "description": string, // A concise description of what the tool does
      "parameter": { // A dictionary of input parameters, ONLY include if explicitly defined
        "param1": "(type) description1",
        "param2": "(Optional, type) description2"
        // ...
      }
    }
    // ...
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. Carefully read the README file provided as input.
2. Extract the MCP server name and a concise, relevant description of its purpose and capabilities. The description should summarize what the server does, but must NOT include installation, configuration, or unrelated operational details.
3. Identify tools/functions provided by the server, being VERY CAREFUL about the following:
   - ONLY extract tools that are explicitly defined with clear function/method names
   - DO NOT create tool names from natural language descriptions or example usages
   - ONLY include "parameter" field if parameters are explicitly defined with names and descriptions, otherwise leave an empty parameter object {}
   - If a section shows example usages with natural language (like "Ask Claude to do X") but doesn't define specific tool names and parameters, DO NOT convert these into tools
   - If a README mentions capabilities without defining specific tool names or parameters, DO NOT invent or infer tool structures
4. For each properly defined tool, extract:
   - The exact tool/function name as stated in the documentation
   - A concise description of what the tool does
   - All explicitly defined input parameters, as a dictionary where the key is the parameter name, and the value is its type + description
5. If the README does not clearly specify any tools with formal definitions, output an empty list [] for "tools".
6. Output ONLY the JSON object, with no extra commentary or explanation.
7. Ensure the output is valid JSON and follows the format strictly.

IMPORTANT: Never invent, assume, or infer information that is not explicitly stated in the README. If information about tools, their descriptions, or parameters is ambiguous or missing, omit it rather than guessing.

Input: The full content of an MCP server README file.
Output: The structured JSON object as described above. 

Below is the input file.
